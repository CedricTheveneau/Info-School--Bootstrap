# Info-School--Bootstrap
First Bootstrap project made while following the Bootstrap course on OpenClassrooms.

It's based on Bootstrap4 and consists in a simple online course website. This website is responsive and adapted to any device thanks to Bootstrap.
It's not linked to any database though so it's kind of pointless. But it sure will be a nice starting point for some of my future projects, as it's a simple base to come back to when I'll need some code snippets while developping.

The website is still accessible though, even if it's really simple and I didn't put much in the other pages -- in fact i only created 1 of the other pages for now.
